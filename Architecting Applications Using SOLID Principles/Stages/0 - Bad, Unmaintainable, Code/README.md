# Architecting Applications Using SOLID Principles

> Some stages will have multiple branches under it to show the path we took when refactoring, and hopefully make it easier to understand.
>
> The best way to learn this is through hands-on experience, so I encourage you to try making your own application in whatever language you prefer while using the concepts within this project.

## Stage 0 - Bad, Unmaintainable, Code

In this stage, we have a simple console application that has been poorly written in regard to maintainability.

The code is stuffed into a single method, and frankly, this is horrible even as short as it is. I had difficulty even writing this and getting it to work at a minimum, but then again it was Friday around 5 PM.

From this stage we will begin our journey of fixing up the console app and attempt follow SOLID Principles as we do it.

## What's Next?

The next stage will be where we move some code into other methods within the same class and begin adhering to the Principle of Single Responsibility.
