# Architecting Applications Using SOLID Principles

Some stages will have multiple branches under it to show the path we took when refactoring, and hopefully make it easier to understand.

The best way to learn this is through hands-on experience, so I encourage you to try making your own application in whatever language you prefer while using the concepts within this project.

## Stage 4 - Interface Segregation

In this stage, we'll go through the app and switch from using an abstract class to an interface, as well as talk about how we've made our interfaces.

### Making Interfaces Small

Often times an interface may grow to be too large or start off

## What's Next?

The next stage will be where we go through our project and make sure it follows Interface Segregation.
